# Face-Detection

This project demonstrates a simple face detection system using OpenCV and Haar Cascades. It allows for detecting and recognizing faces in images using a pre-trained model.

## Features

- Face detection using Haar Cascades.
- Face recognition with OpenCV's LBPH recognizer.
- Training model with stored face data.
- Image testing using the trained model.

 ## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or extract the zip file.
2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
